## _Github Actions_ â€“ self-hosted runners, made easy.

###### _Cost optimized, fully managed, on AWS, powered by CDK._

This is [self-hosted _Github Actions_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) runners packaged as a [CDK construct](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) for easy reuse.

It has been designed to be:

:moneybag: **As cost effective as possible**<br />
:gem: **Highly elastic**<br />
:sleeping_bed: **Minimal maintenance**<br />
:recycle: **Ephemeral**<br />
:hugs: **Easy to use**<br />

## :tophat: Features

- Runners are spun up on-demand when a new job Github Actions job is queued.
- Runners are tore down and underlying instance/container is terminated when the job has been completed.
- There's support for both container (ECS Fargate) and virtual machine (EC2) based runners.
  - VM runners are typically required if a job need access to a Docker daemon.
- It's possible to use any (x86) instance type for VM runners.
- Container based runners can be configured to have 512, 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 5120, 6144, 7168 or 8192 MB of memory.
- Runner type, instance type and memory requirements are configurable per job.

## :traffic_light: Getting started

### First things first

1. Make sure your `~/.aws/credentials` is properly setup.
2. Fire up your Docker engine.
3. Install the CDK CLI, `npm install -g aws-cdk`
4. Bootstrap your AWS account for CDK by running by following the instructions in the [CDK Bootstrapping guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html)

### Define your infrastructure

1. Create a CDK project using the `@spp/github-actions-self-hosted` construct
2. `cdk deploy`
3. Wait for it... Profit!
4. The deploy command will output a webhook hostname. Configure your Github org/repo to send `Workflow jobs` events to that endpoint, e.g. `https://${hostname}/prod/webhook`

## :ribbon: Example project

##### `package.json`

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@spp/github-actions-self-hosted": "^0.1.0",
    "aws-cdk-lib": "^2.3.0"
  }
}
```

#### `index.ts`

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { App } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { GithubActionsRunners } from '@spp/github-actions-self-hosted';

const app = new App();
new GithubActionsRunners(app, 'GithubActionsRunnerStack', {
  env: {
    account: '1234567890',
    region: 'eu-north-1',
  },
  context: 'my-github-org',
  tokenSsmPath: '/github/actions/token',
});
```
