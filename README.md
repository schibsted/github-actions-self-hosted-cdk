## _Github Actions_ â€“ self-hosted runners, made easy.

###### _Cost optimized, fully managed, on AWS, powered by CDK._

This is [self-hosted _Github Actions_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) runners packaged as a [CDK construct](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) for easy reuse.

:moneybag: **As cost effective as possible**<br />
:gem: **Highly elastic**<br />
:sleeping_bed: **Minimal maintenance**<br />
:recycle: **Ephemeral**<br />
:hugs: **Easy to use**<br />

## :tophat: Features

- Runners are spun up on-demand when a new job Github Actions job is queued.
- Runners are tore down and underlying instance/container is terminated when the job has been completed.
- There's support for both container (ECS Fargate) and virtual machine (EC2) based runners.
  - VM runners are typically required if a job need access to a Docker daemon.
- It's possible to use any (x86) instance type for VM runners.
- Container based runners can be configured to have 512, 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 5120, 6144, 7168 or 8192 MB of memory.
- Runner type, instance type and memory requirements are configurable per job.
